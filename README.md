I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a unique background in Communications, Writing and a dedication to Learning. I specialize in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.js) and am proficient in other technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase and more.

I am known for my ability to combine technical skills with unique designs to create user-friendly applications. I am also recognized for my presentation skills and my ability to clearly communicate ideas with unmatched enthusiasm.

I recently completed a 12-week intensive program where I gained valuable technical programming skills. I am excited to put my new skills to use and continue to grow as a developer.

Take a look at my projects and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in working together.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
